# FST-Wave

A FST (digital waveform format) reader/writer library.

### Goals:

 - Wrap my head around this format
 - Document EVERYTHING
 - Ability to read/write FST files
 - See where Rust's strengths/weaknesses are for this
 - Write first, optimize later
 - Parallel writing eventually
 - Build a converter or two around it.
